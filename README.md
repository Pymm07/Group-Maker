# Group-Maker

The group maker code is a running functioning code that you can make groups of 2,3, and 4
But first you would have to enter two names that can't work together following the format, or if there are no one that can't work together then you would enter no
Then if you enter the names in wrong then you would get an invalid you would have to do step one again
but if you dont then the code will ask you to enter a number of people that you want in a group 2,3, or 4
you enter the number in the code and it will generate the groups with the amount of people that you desire and the people that you don't want working together
then the code will ask you if you are done you would enter y or n if y code terminates and if n then the code will loop over again
